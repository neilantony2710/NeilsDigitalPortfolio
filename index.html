          Hey! My name is Neil Antony and I am currently a student at Dublin
          High. My main career goal is to get admission into a prestigious
          computer science university. I plan to achieve this by excelling in
          both academics and extracurriculars. When I complete a four year
          program, I hope to land a job as a software engineer in a prestigious
          tech company. With my knowledge on computer science, and a degree from
          a great school, this goal will be relatively easy to achieve. I plan
          to prepare myself for the rigorous coding interviews by doing a lot of
          practice on algorithms and learning how to apply them to common
          interview problems. In addition, I will also start building passion
          projects that teach me important coding concepts. I love any and all
          technology because technology enables the advancement of our world. I
          have had an affinity for technology ever since code days at my
          elementary school's computer lab. I love being able to make people’s
          lives easier with simple lines of code. Additionally, I have always
          enjoyed problem-solving and computer programming which makes me the
          perfect fit for anything programming. I would be ecstatic if I could
          join a team of excellent programmers working to better the lives of
          people. I would make a valuable asset to the engineering field because
          of my innovative and versatile skills, and my ability to excel in the
          areas that I am passionate about. Some valuable skills that I have
          that are extremely useful for programming include math. I excel at
          math mainly because I love it, and find it extremely interesting. In
          fact, this passion for math has enabled me to progress faster than my
          peers, and take math courses two years earlier than anticipated. This
          affinity for the things I am passionate about can be seen with coding
          as well. I was able to create an entire social media network, with
          industry level code, as a freshmen in high school. I have also taken
          my passion for coding to the competitive stage in the national
          olympiad. Within my first two competitions, I have been able to
          advance to the silver stage of the olympiad, and I plan to advance all
          the way to platinum(the highest level of the national olympiad) this
          upcoming competition season. However, great leadership and social
          skills are also necessary to advance in the field of computer science.
          My excellent leadership can be seen with my dedication to band,
          another area of passion for me. From starting off as the “new kid”, I
          rose to become a principal trumpet player, and I am currently serving
          as secretary of the band. Through my leadership, and social skills I
          was able to secure this amazing opportunity to lead my band to another
          successful season. In addition, my ability to take initiative has
          enabled me to help my community. I have taken initiative by helping
          create a tutoring curriculum on web development for middle schoolers,
          and tutoring them for free. Overall, with my excellent leadership
          skills alongside my passion for programming, I would make an excellent
          addition to any programming team. Thanks for reading, and check out
          the rest of my website to find projects of mine, and a resume!<br />
